There are six sessions:

- regular + full start
- regular + full start, larger file
- regular + h3
- regular  +h3 + retry

   (rm /tmp/quant*;
   ./bin/client -i en0 https://quic.tech:4433/5000 ;
   rm /tmp/quant*; 
   ./Bin/client -i en0 https://quic.tech:4433/15000 ; 
   rm /tmp/quant*; 
   ./Bin/client -3 -i en0 https://quic.tech:8443/15000 ; 
   rm /tmp/quant*; 
   ./Bin/client -3 -i en0 https://quic.tech:8444/15000 ; 
   rm /tmp/quant*; 
   ./bin/client -u -i en0 https://quic.tech:4433/10000;
   rm /tmp/quant*; 
   ./bin/client -m -i en0 https://quic.tech:4433/20000)
